# PERMISSIONING PROCESS

As public blockchain networks, LACChain Test Networks are open to any entity in Latin America and the Caribbean. As permissioned networks, entities must be authenticated and commit to comply with law, policies, and regulations in order to be permissioned. 

### WRITER NODES

For an entity to be permissioned to run a writer node, it is required to follow the following steps:

1. Read, understand and agree with the [Terms and Conditions for Writer Nodes for LACChain Test Networks](https://github.com/lacchain/pantheon-network/blob/master/TERMS_AND_COND_WRITER_NODE.md) that includes the Privacy Policy, and the Forbidden Use Cases as annexes. 
2. Fill the [Node Agreement](https://github.com/lacchain/besu-network/blob/master/NODE_AGREEMENT.md) and send it signed to info@lacchain.net (as a PDF).
3. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/lacchain/pantheon-network/blob/master/DEPLOY_NODE.md) to deploy a writer node, and send us the enode you get at the end of the process to info@lacchain.net to permission your node.
